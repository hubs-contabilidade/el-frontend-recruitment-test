# Frontend Recruitment Test

This is the `frontend` test to join the Hubs Contabilidade Technology Team. Welcome!

The purpose of this test is to assess your logical reasoning ability, as well as your frontend coding skills, code organization, creativity, independence, and problem-solving.

## The challenge

A visionary customer has come to you with a brilliantly wild business idea. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a landing page that shows off this crazy, one-of-a-kind idea, product, or service to the world ðŸ¤©.

### Requirements
Your mission is to design and code a stunning, responsive, and accessible landing page that convinces visitors that the idea, product, or service is truly amazing. The theme of the landing page is entirely up to you â€” itâ€™s your chance to get creative!

To be truly outstanding, your landing page must have the following sections:

1. Hero Section
A bold, attention-grabbing header introducing the idea, product, or service.

2. Plans & Advantages Section
Here, you should showcase the unique features and highlights of your brilliant business.
- If youâ€™re selling a service or a product, display plans or options with different prices, their advantages and disadvantages;
- If youâ€™re not selling anything, highlight the key features of what youâ€™re presenting â€” strengths, weaknesses, or interesting facts.

3. Contact Form
A basic contact form that collects the visitorâ€™s name, email, and WhatsApp number, with a button to submit the information.

4. Footer
Include the companyâ€™s slogan and/or any other information, links, or badges you consider necessary.


### Technical guidelines

- We expect to see HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript. Feel free to use any framework or library, but using tools like Astro, Gatsby, or plain React may earn you extra points;
- You can write your own styles, but use styling tools like TailwindCSS or similar is perfectly fine (and recommended to save you some time).

### What weâ€™d like to see

- A responsive page that uses semantic HTML and is accessible;
- Form field validations and masks applied:
  - The form doesnâ€™t need to send data to any API, but it would be great to see it working normally, with feedback messages and fields clearing after submission;
- Use of images optimized for web in size and format;
- Optimized code with improvements for SEO and PageSpeed Insights:
  - You can use [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/) to check performance, quality, and accessibility metrics;
- Integration with a public GraphQL API, even a simple one. There are many interesting APIs you can use to build a themed landing page that consumes real data. Get creative! Examples include:
  - [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/);
  - [PokeAPI GraphQL](https://graphql.pokeapi.co/v1beta2/console/);
  - [SWAPI GraphQL (Star Wars)](https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/);
  - Or feel free to search for other options online.

### What will be evaluated

- The overall organization of your code;
- The technical level of the implementation;
- The level of creativity of the implementation;
- The presence and quality of the suggested implementations in section [].

### What we don't recommend doing

- Asking someone to code your test for you;
- Using code generated by AI like ChatGPT, Gemini or similar (we want to evaluate your skills, not the AI's);
- Changing the scope of the project too much;
- Wasting a lot of time doing cool but not very useful things. It's tempting, but focus on finishing what the test asks for first :)

> Please keep in mind that weâ€™re not evaluating whether you can build up an application with a million complex features. Do what you can within your available time. However, remember that the more things you can show, the more points your test will potentially earn.

## Deadline

We expect you to finish your code within `1 week` from the day you received the test.

The rest is up to you! Good luck!

## What and how to delivery?

You must send us an email to `tecnologia@hubscontabilidade.com.br` with the links to your repository containing your source code.

The repository must contain a `README.md` file with step-by-step instructions on how to run your application and, if necessary, additional instructions.

## Any questions?

Please contact us by email at `tecnologia@hubscontabilidade.com.br`. We do not promise to be able to answer all questions, but we will do our best to get back to you as quickly as possible.
